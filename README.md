# GoF_Csharp-15.Interpreter_pattern

The Interpreter Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a language or grammar for interpreting and evaluating expressions. It enables you to build an interpreter that can understand and execute expressions written in that language. This pattern is often used in domain-specific languages (DSLs) or when you need to evaluate complex expressions.

Key components of the Interpreter Pattern:

1. Context: Represents the context or input for the expressions that need to be evaluated.

2. Abstract Expression: An abstract class or interface that defines the interpret method. All concrete expression classes will implement this interface.

3. Terminal Expression: Represents the basic elements of the language and does not have any sub-expressions.

4. Non-terminal Expression: Represents complex expressions composed of multiple sub-expressions.
